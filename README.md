# TorizonCore Build Environment #

The TorizonCore Build Environment is a project that provides a Yocto build environment for building the TorizonCore images, though it can also be used to build the non-Torizon Toradex BSP images. It is based on the crops/poky-container project, see [here](https://github.com/crops/poky-container) for more info.
