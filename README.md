# Torizon OS Build Environment #

The Torizon OS Build Environment is a project that provides a Yocto build environment for building the Torizon OS images, though it can also be used to build the non-Torizon Toradex BSP images. It is based on the crops/poky-container project, see [here](https://github.com/crops/poky-container) for more info.
